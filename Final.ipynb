    "## Creating Match Scores\n",
    "\n",
    "Match scores are on a scale of 1-100. Match scores represent numerically how much one mentee fits with a mentor and vice versa. This takes into account all answers to the form aside from the three qualitative application questions: their goals, why they believe blockchain is important, and why they are interested in blockchain. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you wish to modify match scores by changing the scale or the weight of each attribute, you may do so without necessarily needing to tweak any other function. We assigned weights based on what we believed seemed most important, after viewing past pairings and pairing feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note that match scores are separate for mentors and mentees: that is, if mentee A had a score of 75 for mentor B, mentor B's score for mentee A is not necessarily 75. This is because mentees and mentors can look for different attributes in their potential pairing. Mentee A could specify that they want a mentor who has proficiency in ethereum and governance, but this mentee has no background with these skills. Their most preferred mentor (mentor B) may have a lower score for Mentee A because B marked on their application that they would prefer to mentor someone with familiarity or experience with those skills.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### On qualitative application responses... \n",
    "We decided that these qualitative questions would not significantly contribute to how well matched the pairings are. For instance, mentors and mentees with different appreciations of the importance of blockchain could still be very well matched. In fact, the difference in their values and goals could possibly benefit the pairing: their differences could help each other gain a new appreciation about this vast and contemporary field. These answers are more relative and it is important to provide applicants with a space to write freely. We have chosen to instead display their answers to these questions in the final output dataframe marking all mentor and mentee pairings. Once matched, the mentors and mentees read each other's responses and a conversation begins."

We see below that C4D4 is paired with A5B5. This function furthermore identifies the \"dummy\" applicants created by **stablemarriage** and marks them as unpaired. If an applicant is paired with one of these \"dummy\" applicants, then this means that there is no stable pairing such that they have a match. This is due to the unequal number of mentors and mentees. This is no way means that these mentors/mentees are anyhow unqualified, but instead it merely shows that all other pairings fit better together. \n",

They're both interested in blockhain, crypto, machine learning, web dev, and fintech. They also both like baking. While mentee C12B12 can only meet once every 2-3 weeks, mentor A7B7 wants to meet once a week. They're in the same timezone (PST). They're both introverts, and have similar personalities (ISTJ and ISFJ). The mentor would rather their mentee come in with some familiarity in the skills they practice. Luckily for them, mentee C12D12 has familiarity/amateur experience with all of the skills A7B7 is familiar with. Mentee is interested in some skills including bitcoin, crypto, usability -- and their mentor is at least somewhat familiar with all of these. Overall due to their similar interests, career pursuits, expertise, and personality -- these two would make a great match."

A51 prefers that their mentee has some familiarity with the fields they're good at. They're professional/experienced in entrepreneurship, product, development, usability, De-Fi, ethereum, and blockchain. C26 has industry-level experience in bitcoin, ethereum, usability, familiarity in development, product, and entrepreneurship. Therefore, A51's preference for their mentee to have some background knowledge is fulfilled. They want to gain skills in product, governance, and design -- their mentor is professionally experienced in product, and familiar with the other two. Overall their timezones are close, they share a major, and have similar interests/goals. "

These two are a little more different, in terms of personality and interests, but they share similar professional skills. C43 wants to gain experience in investment, trading, legal, and marketing. A30 is familiar with legal and marketing and is an investor. They are in the same time zone (EST and PRT). This match is a little weaker than the two previous ones in terms of interests, but this is likely because C43 has a more unique set of majors/career path and due to their matching time zone. If major and interests matters more, the **matchscores** function can be modified to give these attributes a greater weight. "
